# A Very Niche Web Scraper

----
The purpose of this project was to explore some concepts in client-side data scraping. This was an exercise in analyzing the source HTML for my old high school's website and outputting some UI to visualize some of the data that was extracted.

# Tools Used:

For this project, I made use of Cors Anywhere in order to make cross-origin requests on the client side. Additionally, I used Highlight.js for syntax highlighting.

# Concepts Used:

* React Hooks
* Data Scraping
* Filters
* Async/await
* Integrating third-party libraries and web services

# What this app does:

The data is visualized in 3 seperate boxes
* The top-left box is the HTML data that was scraped from the web page
* The bottom-left box is the function I wrote in my code that is responsible for scraping the data
* The right box displays the information that is stored in the object that is created from the webscraper function
